        [FIXES]
        The file_filter was getting called incorrectly.  I was
        setting $File::Next::file instead of $File::Next::name.

        I've now also added tests to make sure that it's getting
        set correctly.

        First real version.  Don't use 0.01 any more.

        Iterator now returns separate file & directory components
        in array context.

        Rewrote internals.
